# Problem Description

(copy this info from specification doc)
What is the problem or the task that you're
addressing with your JavaScript project?

# Instructions for Running Code

If it's a browser based app, which HTML file should they open?
If it's a stand alone JavaScript application, which JS file
should they run in Node.JS?

Is there any extra dependencies, libraries, and so that need
to be installed for the code to run?

# Typical App Behaviour

Describe what your app is supposed to do, how it works.
What input should a user provide?
What output should a user expect to see?
Give typical use case scenario for your application?

# Any Problems

Make a note of any functionality that doesn't quite work in
the expected way, in your code. Perhaps something that you
started but didn't get time to finish.

# Highlights

Give some information about features you're particularly
proud of, things you worked hard on, they work well,
and you're really pleased about this.
# Project Scope
Describe the general application area of your project idea
 General Application Area:
E-commerce website for buying and selling shoe
 Target audience:
Customers and shop Owners
# Problem Description
Describe the precise problem you are addressing.
 Manual order processing and inventory management for a shoe shop
 Lack of online presence for the shop
Consequences:
 Inefficient order fulfillment
 Limited customer reach
 Potential errors in manual processes
# Functional Requirements
List three to six concrete requirements for your program.
Customer-facing features:
 Product catalog with filtering and search
 Shopping cart with quantity management
 Secure checkout process with payment options
 Order confirmation and tracking
 User account management (optional)
 Admin dashboard features:
 Inventory management (importing from CSV, updating stock levels)
 Order processing and fulfillment
 Customer information management
 Sales reports and analytics
# Building Blocks
Are you using any JavaScript libraries?
Are you creating any interesting data structures?
JavaScript libraries:
 AngularJs for frontend structure and reactivity
 Axios or Fetch API for making HTTP requests
 Papa Parse for CSV parsing
 Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization (optional)
Data structures:
 Arrays or objects to store product data
 Objects for user information and orders
 Map for efficient inventory lookups
# Breakdown into Functions
Can you identify functions that will implement the key aspects
of your application?
Key functions:
 Display product catalog with filtering and search
 Add items to cart and manage quantities
 Handle checkout process and payment
 Send order confirmation emails
 Import product data from CSV
 Update inventory levels based on orders
 Generate sales reports and analytics
# Additional Considerations
Frontend:
User interface design and responsiveness
User experience optimization
Backend:
Server-side technology (Node.js, Express) for data storage and processing
Database integration (MongoDB, MySQL)
Security measures for payment processing and sensitive data
